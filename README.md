# Mathias Rauls Portfolio Website 2022 

I built this website as a portfolio to highlight my experience and skills in Front-End Web Development.

I'm hoping that this website will help me advance my profession and give me access to more opportunities.

Building this website taught me a lot about how to design an online area that is both useful and aesthetically pleasing. By learning more about the programming languages used for this project, as I built it, I was able to construct a website that smoothly and orderly scales with the user's browser. Additionally, I learned how to add more Javascript to the website. I added a feature using this Javascript that would let users identify the section of the page they were viewing based on where they were on the page.

The straightforward yet enjoyable and interactive design of my project makes it stand out. The 3D elements seen in numerous sections were made by myself using blender.
